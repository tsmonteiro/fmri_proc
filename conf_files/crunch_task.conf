DO_COPY=1        # Copy to temporary folder
DO_REG=1         # Native space spatial preprocessing
DO_REG2=1        # func2anat2mni calculations
DO_ICA=1         # MELODIC decomposition
DO_NORM=1        # Normalise EPI images to MNI spaces and perform final steps 
DO_QA=1          # Generate QA Plots for the individual data
DO_QA_NATIVE=0   # Generate QA Plots for the individual data in subject space (i.e. not MNI) [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
DO_CLEAN=0       # Remove remove temporary/intermediate files

DO_ATLAS_NAT=0   # Normalize Atlas to native space

# How to perform motion correction
# Options are slomoco and 3dvolreg
# slomoco seems to work better, but takes a huge amount of time [30s vs 1h on my machine]
MOCO=3dvolreg




# MISC. Parameters

TR=3

# 1 - Sequential
# 2 - Interleaved
# 3 - Parallel [Not Used, as nothing is currently being done in terms of slice acquisition for MB imaging]
ACQ_TYPE=1 


# Perform bias correction on functional data
# In general, this is not needed
# Empirically, I [Thiago] have observed that it can improve processing quality in low contrast scanners (Siemens Verio and GE, more specifically)
# For the rest, recommended it is not to do this
DO_FUNC_BIAS=0


# When registering functional to anatomical, use FSL's epi_reg function
# N.B.: This requires good tissue contrast in the FUNCTIONAL DATA or it might not work
# In that case, rigid registration is done using FLIRT
USE_BBR=1

DO_SLC=1

# Perform fieldmap correction (currently, this means reverse phase volumes are needed)
# 1 - REVPHASE
# 2 - FMAP

DO_FMAP=2 

# Effective echo spacing
# wfs[rs_crunch] = 10.570
# ees = (((1000 * 10.249)/(434.215 * (41+1))/1) = 10249 / 18237.3 = 0.60856948746589s

EES=0.00056198

# Try to estimate respiration and cardiac effects using PESTICA method
# 0 - No physiological estimation
# 1 - Run PESTICA4
# 2 - Run PHYCAA+
DO_PEST=1

# Use high resolution anatomical image to infer distortion (should not be used in conjuntion with previous step)
DO_ANAT_FMAP=0

# Do the ANAT fmap correction on the native scans
CORRECT_ANAT_FMAP_NATIVE=0
DO_DEOBL=1



# Run AFNI's Despike program
DO_DPK=1

# Global intensity normalisation [i.e. Global Mean]
DO_ING=0 
GLOB_VAL=1000 # Mean to which glboal intensity is normalised

# Skullstripping procedure. Normally, neural network procedure works better, but it is wise to double check
# 1 - NeuralNetwork Extraction
# 2 - FSL's BET
BREXT_TYPE=1


DO_SMOOTH=0
# TWO possible options to do smoothing
# 1 - FWHM Gaussian kernel as it is typically done. Uses either FSL's fslmaths or AFNI's 3dmerge
#	IT seems to me that 3dmerge results in slightly less smooth images for some reason
#
# 2 - Non-Local Means is an anisotropic filter that works on either gaussian or rician noise and preserves image edges
DO_FWHM=0 
DO_NLM=0

# Uses template segmented tissues as priors in subject's segmentation [FAST]
# N.B.: Those should be in alignment with the MNI template used

# Nuisance regression models
# Variance explained by those options will be projected out of functional data using 3dTproject
# OPTIONS at the moment here are:
# RP24WM1CSF1   - Motion estimates (derivative, square of both), mean WM, mean CSF
# RP9           - Motion estimates, mean WM, mean CSF, global signal
# RP24CC	- Motion estimates (derivative, square of both), WM + CSF CompCorr
# SRP24WM1CSF1  - Motion estimates (derivative, square of both), mean WM, mean CSF + Censor Spikes
# SRP9          - Motion estimates, mean WM, mean CSF, global signal + Censor Spikes
