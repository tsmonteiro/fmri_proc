Contributing
============
If you want to contribute to pydeface and make it better, your help is very welcome.

## Opening an issue

- Please post your quesions, bug reports and feature requests [here](https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface/issues).
- When reporting a bug, please specify your system and a complete copy of the error message that you are getting.

## Making a pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine.
- Create a new branch to work on. Branch from `devel`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target `devel` branch of the original pydeface repository.

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
